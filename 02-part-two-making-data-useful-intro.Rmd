# Making Data Durable


Elsewhere in this text we’ve covered approaches to creating digital archaeology data. Section 1.1 discusses three great habits to maintain while working digitally ref back to “The first steps in going digital are quite easy. They are fundamentally a question of maintaining some basic good habits. Everything else flows from these three habits:” section 1.1.6. These principles will help you and future researchers use your data, reproduce your conclusions and “future-proof” your digital work.

Prepare yourself for a little journey. In a dreamlike state, you find yourself in a time machine, noticing that you have traveled to a point in the far or not-so-distant future. You arrive in your own lab to find a group of researchers puzzling over the information you created in the time before, trying to reconstruct your conclusions and make some kind of sense of it all.

    "What are these strange codes?"
    "Does this thing go with that? It looks like there's a bit missing, but we can't be sure."
    "What was on all those corrupted flash drives? Does anyone even have a flash-drive-to-skull-jack converter around here?"
    "WHAT WAS THIS PERSON THINKING?"

It doesn't have to be this way. Most archaeological researchers have encountered “bad” data in the past when trying to understand or reconstruct someone’s conclusions from field notes and excavation reports. What makes a dataset bad?

*It’s not understandable.* The dataset may be illegible (poor handwriting, or a bad scan of a hard copy document). It might be made up of codes with no way to decipher their meaning. It might be a digital binary file that can no longer be read by available software (or on a physical format that’s now obsolete).

*It can’t be easily accessed.* The dataset might be saved in a format that only expensive, proprietary software can read. It might be comprised of a lot of fascinating information but challenging to extract from a format like PDF.

*It’s difficult to reuse.* The dataset might use inconsistent terminology. The data might be saved as an image, when in fact it's got a structure. [should a definition of structured data go here or somewhere else?]

With these frustrations in mind, the qualities of "good" data become apparent. Good data are stable, human readable, and accessible. They can be rearranged and remixed. As an added benefit, those same qualities that make data useful and conclusions reproducible can also help to protect against the ravages of time.

#### Pre-Planning #### {-}

You’ll notice that quality data (however you define the term) take planning. The structure of your data and the practicalities of how you’ll handle and store it should be woven into your research design. A reality to confront, however, is that there will be tradeoffs.

Up front, right at the beginning, when you’re working out your research questions and goals, ask yourself some questions. What do I want my data to do? How much detail do I need to collect? Do I have a plan for curating datasets I’ve created? Is there space somewhere to do so? Will I need to be selective?

Perfection is unattainable. No dataset will ever be truly “complete.” You could collect, measure, and produce data at finer and finer resolutions, ad infinitum. But you don’t want to do that. And even if you think you're being comprehensive, all data you collect is only a specific, bounded representation of the real world.  

The concept of Paradata as implemented in events like the Heritage Jam [link/reference] can be applied broadly to analytical and technical digital projects to great effect. Originally documented in the London Charter for Computer-based Visualization of Cultural Heritage [source and link], paradata (literally data alongside the data) are narrative descriptions of process. Keeping a paradata file can help to illustrate some of the assumptions we naturally make when producing and grooming data. Data are never "raw". [Gitelman, Lisa, ed. Raw data is an oxymoron. MIT Press, 2013.] In the context of an archaeological excavation with published analysis, this information might take the form of sections of a gray literature report or an appendix to a publication. Or it might be a text document that travels along side a collection of data files as a "readme."
