## Designing Data Collection

In teaching, there is a concept called 'backwards design', where you design your lesson from the end point you wish your students to achieve. The same is true of data. Knowing that archaeology is destructive, and that the processes of archaeology _creates_ new kinds of artefacts (drawings, photos, record sheets, labels, and so on), we need to start at the end. Ideally, it is an end point that will allow someone else to reconsider the archaeological record that you have created. As Gavin Lucas @lucas2012understand writes, the idea of an 'archaeological record' is a three-fold, trinity-like concept-

- the material culture broadly understood
- the 'formation theory' of how that material culture came to be
- and the materialization of the construction of that material culture in the present: our archive

And so, we will begin this section on data collection by thinking through where the _things_ are going to go.

**Modes of collection**

*Paper to digital*
Sometimes the most straightforward way to collect data in the field is to write it on paper. Paper forms can't run out of batteries. Data loss and integrity issues are still real, but massive data loss may be less of a threat when working with paper, depending on backup mechanisms.
- designing paper forms
- what about  marginalia?
*Born digital*
- mobile data collection
- limits without over-constraining
- list of open resources

Importance of training

**Creating structure**

**Where to put your data**

LOCKSS
Choosing a repository
	Does it have room for your stuff?
	Is your stuff within the purview of its digital archivists?
	How long is this place going to be around?
	Does it have plans for migrating and maintaining your files?
Choosing what you want to curate
Simple formats = easier migration
    Convert databases to xml or csv tables with relationships
    Lossless files. TIFF over JPEG
    CAD- no archival alternative
    Geospatial- GeoJSON is text-based and human readable
    3D- a new frontier in digital preservation (we donâ€™t know how to do it)
