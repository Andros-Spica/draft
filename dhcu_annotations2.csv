2017-10-05T00:22:51,https://thenewinquiry.com/the-ladies-vanish/,thatVargas,Uu5cMKljEeeQMOOsgd1zxA,9ZoPkNzN,"While the entire tech industry has huge gender disparities, the gender gap gets significantly more pronounced when we look specifically at the more prestigious tech departments. E.g: Facebook is 69% male, while their tech team is 85% male. Google overall is 70% male, their tech team 83%. Twitter is 70% male; tech team: 90%.","I am always skeptical of numbers as percentages used to make a point. Mainly because my instinct is always to ask, ""according to whom"" and ""compared to what"". In this case, I am curious to know whether the skew towards male employees is symptomatic of a bigger issue, not enough women choosing this field in their education and as a careers. The question then is, would the numbers be more balanced if there was more women as part of the pool of resources to choose from?"

Railroads, highways, high rises, etc., all have a history of these hidden narratives of the people that built them. To some extent, even the iPhone that I am typing this on, has a normalized narrative of f being built in China, as an aggregated, genderless, faceless persona.   What is worrying to me is that this seems to be part of a larger notion of consumers compromising values and to some extent certain ethics, opting for convenience. Security and privacy of personal information would also fall into this.   In the long run, what will we accept as OK, be cause we gain more benefit than the cost to our humanity? That's also worrying."

The code in this case needs to adopted by users in order to move from a weak concept to a strong/dominant one. The users can be considered as actants in the development of what Steven Ward refers to as an encompassing network. As Raymond highlights, users can lead to the development and improvement of the code. "
