## Artificial Intelligence in Digital Archaeology 

To speak of 'artificial intelligence' in archaeology may be to speak too soon yet. We do have machine learning in the service of archaeology (neural networks for classificatory purposes, for instance), and there is a well-established body of work in terms of simulation that could fall under the rubric of 'artificial intelligence'.

Then why use the term? We think it is still useful to use the term because it reminds us that, in using computational power for simulation or image classification we are off-loading some of our expertise and abilities to a non-human actor. In the case of machine learning and neural networks, we really *can't* see inside the 'black box'. But we can examine the training data, for it is in the selection of training data that we introduce biases or agendas into the computation. By thinking of the machine in this case as something non-human, our hope is that we remind you to not accept the results or methods of AI in archaeology blindly, as if the machine was not capable of racist or colonialist results. 

Machine learning: a series of techniques that endeavour to train a computer program to identify and classify data according to some previously determined values. We will in this chapter discuss image recognition using the neural network model trained by Google, the Inception3 model, which we will query using the Tensorflow package.

Agent based simulation: a series of techniques that create a population of software 'agents' who are programmed with contextual rules governing the behaviour of individual agents. The context can be both in terms of the simulated environment (GIS data, for instance) or the social environment (social relationships as a network). The simulation iterates over an entire landscape of possible variables, creating a 'behaviour space' which is then used by the investigator to understand the emergent behaviour in the situation, to understand better the possible range of situations that could account for the observed phenomenon in the 'real world'.

The value of machine learning: it makes us think carefully about what we are looking for and at in the first place; and then it can be scaled massively.

The value of agent-based modeling: it forces us to think carefully about what it is we think actually *happened* in the past such that it can be encoded as a series of individual-level instructions. 


### Agent-based modeling (ABM)

>Andreas: "Hello World!"
Overview

#### Models, simulation, and the precursors of ABM

- def system, model, formal model
- The origins of computer simulation
- Equation-based modeling, System Dynamics - ODE systems as models (mention Lorenz attractor, end with the idea of iteration of a process)
- Algorithm-based modeling, Algorithms as behavioral models (mention cellular automata, Van Neumann, Schelling, etc)
- The variety of algorithm-based models, much coincides with the variety of programming paradigm.
a. Flow: spectrum between centralized (iteration of a single process, e.g. event) and distributed (multiple processes are iterated contextually by multiple entities).
b. Schedule: spectrum between fully-scheduled (processes are initiated in a predetermined order) and event-driven (processes are initiated given a certain input).
ABMs fall somewhere in-between these two spectra, though normally leaning towards distributed (e.g., using Monte Carlo methods) and fully-scheduled. Applications in several disciplines (see Wikipedia)

#### ABM in History and Social Sciences

- Emergence... Life game, deterministic chaos
- Saving the gap between atomism and holism, or individual and social structure
- Virtual laboratory for social sciences
- Examples
- Mention the cycles of enthusiasm and skepticism, and the tendency to develop closed circles
- Challenges and pitfalls 

### discussion

#### Why model with ABM?

- open with the idea that we are always modeling
- Mention review article 'Why model?'

#### How to model with ABM?

- Parts of an ABM model
 (re-visit presentations)
- Define hypotheses, questions or simply the phenomenon of interest (identify the system)
- Define the elements and processes (you believe are) required to address the system (model the system). mention paradox Occam's razor vs. emergence
- Express the chosen elements and processes as computer code (implement the model)
- Modeling is a process of constant iteration. Each stage is an iteration loop that is often repeated several times before jumping into the next step.  The end result of development and exploration of a model may be relatively stable, often in the form of publications. However, this product potentially feeds a new  modeling effort (and that is actually the main usefulness of models in the long run). 
- ABM in python, Java, C#, or C++? in R? in NetLogo? (Any language can do it, really). Pros and cons, talk in terms of higher/lower level programming languages (still, they are all quite high-level).
- remember to talk about https://www.openabm.org/

### exercises

- The Pond Trade (coastal settlements of variable size around a pond; cultural vectors; trade ships travel between the settlements, re-evaluating afterwards if the trip is worse or better than other previous trips (make table); they carry economic value and cultural traits from between the base and destination settlements)

SG: code chunks didn't render correctly through the bookdown generation process, which is baffling. check the original bookdown book for how to sort this out. removed the executable code chunk, put it into a different script, ran it, copied the output here. this is not optimal.

- Implement the model based on general definition (agents, variables, parameters)
- Walk-through the implementation in NetLogo
- Simulations and experiment design
- Analysis and display of results (R example)
