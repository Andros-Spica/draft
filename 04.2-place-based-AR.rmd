## Place-based Interpretation with Locative Augmented Reality

Augmented reality is the use of various technologies to overlay data onto one's visual or aural perception of the environment. Augmented reality does not need to be a digital technology - it can be as simple as a sheet of plexiglass/perspex framing a view of an archaeological site, etched so that the 'missing' structure(s) can be seen, as at Carnuntum in Austria.

Augmented reality does not need to be a visual technology, either.
