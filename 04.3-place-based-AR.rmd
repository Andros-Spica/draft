## Place-based Interpretation with Locative Augmented Reality

<div class = rmdcaution> _This section is under development_. </div>

Augmented reality is the use of various technologies to overlay data onto one's visual or aural perception of the environment. Augmented reality does not need to be a digital technology - it can be as simple as a sheet of plexiglass/perspex framing a view of an archaeological site, etched so that the 'missing' structure(s) can be seen, as at Carnuntum in Austria.

Augmented reality does not need to be a visual technology, either. @poole_2018 demonstrate a use of audio-based augmented reality to create 'soundpools' or areas of physical space that trigger a 'time radio' into playing snippets of overheard conversations and soundscapes that are combined with a choose-your-own-adventure game mechanic. Called 'Ghosts in the Garden', the experience was meant to give visitors to a historic site the tools for constructing their own understanding of the place. @poole_2018 define three major uses for augmented reality in the context of heritage places:

> as an augmented guidebook and information resource, as a tool for enhanced simulation, and (less frequently) as a tool for changing the rules by which we construct and define historical knowledge at heritage sites.

Most archaeological applications of AR tend to fall into those first two categories, although there are individuals and teams who are pushing the boundaries. Consider the following two videos were winning entries in the [HeritageJam](http://www.heritagejam.org/) at York University in recent years.

The first uses an aural AR approach to challenge our understanding of the space of a cemetery, while the second uses AR to enhance our archaeological eye for the purposes of research and study. Both of these approaches require a fair degree of technical fluency and require constant maintenance as platforms and devices cycle through their planned obsolescences.

### Projection Mapping

Projection mapping is a kind of AR that uses digital video projectors and specialized software on your computer to block out areas of light so that the different areas show different videos or images at the same time. Instead of a rectangle of light, one can 'map' the boundaries of the projection areas to match the architecture of a building facade (for example). Other terms for this include 'spatial augmented reality' or 'video mapping'.

The artist [Craig Winslow](http://craigwinslow.com/work/lightcapsules/) used the technology to bring the faded historic signage of Winnipeg's downtown back to life. History MA student Cristina Wood used it to reintroduce the social history of a district of the City of Ottawa into the massive construction site it has since become in [Picturing Lebreton Flats](http://picturinglebretonflats.ca), using the open source [Mapmap](https://mapmapteam.github.io/) toolkit.


### exercises

1. The best introduction to producing augmented reality is currently Jacob Greene's [Creating Mobile Augmented Reality Experiences in Unity](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-mobile-augmented-reality-experiences-in-unity#setting-up-unity-for-ar-development) at the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org). In this tutorial, he demonstrates how to use the built in features of the [Unity 3d](https://unity3d.com) game engine to create smartphone AR applications. Complete the tutorial, and then extend the application by adding 3d models (there are creative-commons licensed models at [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) in their 'cultural heritage' category) to it. 
2. The interactive fiction engined [Twine](https://twinery.org) can be hacked to create webpages that only display certain text passages or audio or images if the user is standing in a particular location. See the [Twine Cookbook's](https://twinery.org/cookbook/) 'Geolocation' section. A walk through of using this feature is [here](https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/Hacking%20Twine%20to%20make%20a%20location-based%20game.md). Play with this to plan out a hand-held guide to your campus.
