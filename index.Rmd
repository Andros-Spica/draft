# notice {-}

This volume goes hand-in-glove with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) coupled with the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service as a way of serving and running interactive computational environments online via a browser. This relieves both instructors and students of the problems of installing software in different environments and the troubleshooting that this entails. Instead, students and instructors can concentrate on the learning and writing literate code that explores archaeological issues. To launch the ODATE notebooks, please go to the [list of notebooks](https://o-date.github.io/support/notebooks-toc/) and hit the `launch binder` button. To examine or download the code, click the `repository` links instead. 

As you read this text and explore the notebooks, feel free to 'fork' (copy) the [source text files](source-markdown-files) and to reuse or remix them for your own use. The source files are text files written with minimal markup (headers, images, bold, italics, and so on, in markdown format) that may be opened in any word processor or text editor; the [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) program can convert the markdown into Word or other formats if you prefer. 

THIS IS A DRAFT VERSION; it's not even version 0.1 yet. It is filled with errors, omissions, and non-sequiturs. 

_Citation Information_: A permanent DOI courtesy of [zenodo.org](http://zenodo.org) will be provided September 2018.
